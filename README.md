# Cpp-Complex-numbers
<p align="justify">This is an excercise tutor gave to the students to practice oprator overloading. <br>The topic was to create complex numbers class and overflow oprators "+" and "*" to make basic arithmetic operations possible. <br>Overflowing operators "<<" and ">>" is aimed to read complex numbers from keyboard and print them. <br> <br>
Class name and some prints are written in Polish, which is a flaw I'll correct soon</p>
